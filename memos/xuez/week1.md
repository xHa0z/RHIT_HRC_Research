## Week 1 Memo

----
This week is the first week of this project. All work is about setting up. 
During this week, I set up a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/xHa0z/RHIT_HRC_Research) to hold our project code and some documentations. I also wrote a brief direction about how to use Github and sent out to all team members. 

A draft of system diagram is also created with Microsoft Visio. This diagram contains all parts we need to implement during this quarter and different sub teams for each individual tasks.

In order to have a working space to work on our project and place robot arm, I applied a Myer room and this application should be assigned by the end of next week. 

I also worked on Leap Motion this week. Leap Motion is a gesture capture device that use two cameras to set up a 3D model of your hand or some other pointer and track the movement of hands and fingers. I installed Leap Motion control software and SDK on my laptop and ran some built-in demo to test device functionality. 

Besides, I read two paper about gesture input and gesture control as well. And wrote literature review on them. 

I tried to schedule a meeting for team to talk about this project, looks like most of team are available at Wednesday afternoon, so the first unofficial meeting will be held at 4.30 pm on Wednesday in the Library Conference room.
